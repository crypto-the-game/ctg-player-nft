## CTG Player NFT

This NFT is an upgraded and modified version of the ZORA 721 Drops supporting a more granular sales configuration, new solidity, new ERC721A, and a fully-featured transfer hook system.

CTG wants to be able to cleanly modify user player interactions on the smart contract level requiring some changes in this implementation.

The smart contract itself is deployed from a deployer wallet and the brand wallet then calls a function to actually deploy the contract from there.
